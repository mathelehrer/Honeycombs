This repository only contains the mathematica worksheet that was used to calculate the vertices and edges that have been used in the animations
I just occasionally use mathematica, therefore I'm glad about improvements or recommendations

If you don't own a license of mathematica you still can download the Mathematica Player and have a look at the file. 

The animations are published under:
